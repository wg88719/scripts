# scripts

A collection of scripts useful for developing embedded systems using the Xilinx
tool chain (Vivado, SDK, etc.)

For usage information on each individual script please refer to the script
headers.

The scripts are sorted by directory according to the tool in which they can be
executed. Unless otherwise noted in the script header, each script assumes that
an active processor connection has already been established.
